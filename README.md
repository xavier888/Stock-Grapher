# Stock-Grapher
Personal project

This program allows the user enter a stock ticker and then displays a xchart/swing-generated graph showing the prices 
since market opening. 
I wanted to make the graph update in real time but I still haven't figured out how. 
Additionally, since this program pulls prices from Google Finance, using this program frequently may cause Google Finance to
suspect you are a bot and throw up a captcha.
