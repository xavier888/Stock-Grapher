# Stock-Grapher
This program allows the user enter a stock ticker and then displays a xchart/swing-generated graph showing the prices 
since market opening. 
I want to make the graph update in real time using swing but haven't figured out how. 
Additionally, since this program pulls prices from Google Finance, using it frequently may cause Google Finance to
throw up a captcha.
